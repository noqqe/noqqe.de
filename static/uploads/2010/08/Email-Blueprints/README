Email Blueprints is a collection of HTML email templates that can serve as a solid
foundation and starting point for the design of emails. They include template language
elements that make them customizable when imported into a MailChimp account, as well
as merge tags that will generate dynamic content when sent through MailChimp. Not a 
MailChimp user? You can sign up free at http://www.mailchimp.com/signup or simply strip
out merge tags and use these templates to send through any system.

All templates have been tested vigorously in all major email clients. If you find a bug
we would greatly appreciate your patch submission to the Git Hub repository:
