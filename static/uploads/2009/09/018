Fry: The less fortunate get all the breaks!
Bender: Since I love you all so much, I'd like to give everyone hugs.
Fry: There's a lot about my face you don't know.
Bender: Hooray, we don't have to do anything!
Bender: An upgrade? I thought we all agreed I was perfect.
Fry: You'll barely regret this.
Bender: Ah crap, I'm some sort of robot!

Leela: I'm a millionaire! Suddenly I have an opinion about the capital gains tax.
Fry: Why use my own legs like an idiot when I can use a Chickenwalker?
Bender: Curse my natural showmanship!
Fry: It's all there, in the macaroni.
Fry: I must be a robot. Why else would human women refuse to date me?
Bender: But-- those girls don't wear cases! You can see their bare circuits!
Bender: In the event of an emergency, my ass can be used as a flotation device.
Bender: Nothing like a warm fire and a super-soaker of fine cognac.
Fry: It's like a party in my mouth and everyone's throwing up.
Bender: I'm not allowed to sing. Court order.
Bender: And I bet it's gonna get a lot more confusing.

Fry: It's a widely-believed fact!
Fry: People said I was dumb but I proved them!
Bender: We're both expressible as the sum of two cubes!
Bender: This guy's not making any sense. Can I kill him? Please?
Bender: I'm a fraud. A poor, lazy, sexy fraud.

Fry: No, no, I was just picking my nose.
Bender: OK, but I don't want anyone thinking we're robosexuals.

Bender: Listen up, cause I got a climactic speech.
Bender: Aw, this bends!
Bender: I'm tired of this room and everyone in it!
Leela: This toads the wet sprocket.
Bender: Gimme your biggest, strongest, cheapest drink.
Bender: My life, and by extension everyone else's, is meaningless.
Bender: Boy, who knew a cooler could also make a handy wang coffin?
Bender: They're tormenting me with uptempo singing and dancing!
Fry: Leela, Bender, we're going grave-robbing.
Fry: But this is HDTV. It's got better resolution than the real world.
Fry: Leela, there's nothing wrong with anything.
Bender: Well I don't have anything else planned for today, let's get drunk!

Bender: Life is hilariously cruel.
Bender: Fry, of all the friends I've had ... you're the first.
Fry: There's a political debate on. Quick, change the channel!
Fry: I can burp the alphabet. A, B, D ... no, wait ...
Fry: They're great! They're like sex except I'm having them.
Bender: Shooting DNA at each other to make babies. I find it offensive!
Bender: There! That oughtta convert a few tailgaters.
Fry: Sweet justice! Sweet, juicy justice!
Bender: Ahhh, functional.
Bender: Curse you, merciful Poseidon!
Bender: Now that's hospital dancing.
Bender: Oh, so, just 'cause a robot wants to kill humans that makes him a radical?
Fry: The butter in my pocket is melting!
Bender: Senseless death! The folk singer's best friend!

Fry: I did it! And it's all thanks to the books at my local library.
Fry: Prepare to be thought at!
Bender: A woman like that you gotta romance first!
Bender: You can't count on God for jack! He pretty much told me so himself.
Leela: This is by a wide margin the least likely thing that has ever happened.
Bender: Oh no! Not the magnet!
Leela: He opened up relations with China. He doesn't want to hear about your ding-dong.
Fry: I'm not a robot like you -- I don't like having disks crammed into me. Unless they're Oreos. And then only in the mouth.
Bender: Boy, were we suckers!
Leela: My old life wasn't as glamorous as my webpage made it look.
Bender: Fathero!
Fry: I'll be whatever I wanna do.
Bender: Want me to smack the corpse around a little?
Bender: Crippling pain? That's not covered by my insurance fraud.
